MESSAGE
As XIME prepares itself to welcome its next batch of students to the Post Graduate
Diploma in Management (PGDM), I am delighted to share with you the gratification
that we have as an Institution with campuses in the three major cities of South
India – Bangalore, Chennai and Kochi.
Founded on a strong value system that focuses on merit, integrity and ethics, XIME
takes pride in being a centre of excellence in business education. XIME provides to
the students a comprehensive learning opportunity in the contemporary business
environment, inculcating in them strong business fundamentals and managerial
competencies. Sensitivity to societal issues is promoted through a structured
project on ‘Socially Useful and Productive Activity’. Towards all-round
development, our campus clubs provide students a platform to hone their latent
strengths and talents. Activities of these clubs have helped XIME in generating a
winning streak for itself in numerous inter-collegiate and other competitive
events.
While student diversity is a distinguishing factor, the Institute has been able to
attract a highly talented faculty group who are products of leading B-schools,
inside and outside the country.
XIME has a constant and vibrant industry interaction continuously enhancing the
curriculum and multi-modal teaching aimed at world class learning outcomes. Its
partnership with several high ranking foreign Institutions has also given it a global
orientation.
In sum, our aim at XIME is to develop managers who by dint of their capabilities
and quality of character can respond in a creative and wholesome way to the
diverse opportunities and challenges in the world of business and industry.
Join XIME and benefit from a stimulating environment for the
development of your personal and professional potential.

Chairman, XIME Bangalore
Former Director, IIM-Bangalore
Dear Aspiring Leaders,􀀁
03
Since its inception in 1991, XIME’s founding mission has been to shape future leaders and hence contribute
towards nation-building. We believe there are multiple paths towards true leadership. And at XIME, we
provide the environment for each student to discover their own. For some, it’s discovering hidden facets of
themselves that inspire others. For most, the two years spent on XIME’s stimulating, challenging, yet
nurturing campus have been transformative.
Over decades, we have watched generations of eager and avid learners step onto campus with big dreams
and evolve towards their own brand of leadership - showcasing the key qualities of competence, setting
value-driven goals, and acquiring a broader worldview. XIME’s 4000+ strong alumni network proves how an
Institute’s mission can enable students to discover their individual paths towards leadership. The journey of
our founder, Prof. J. Philip, who today at 87 years of age, perfectly exemplifies what we want each XIME
student to be lifelong, unstoppable, and driven by a higher purpose.
XIME’s PGDM is a constantly evolving programme, keeping pace with today’s dynamic, rapidly changing and
technology-driven corporate world. At XIME, the learning is rigorous and purposeful, leveraging the case
method and experience-based management education. And this is complemented by values that drive
positive social impact, resulting in well-rounded leaders who’re equally ready to transform businesses as
well as society.
Strategic Thinking & Problem Solving
Strategic thinking and problem solving is honed through hands-on experience with near real-life scenarios
utilising case studies and simulations. XIME employs Harvard case study and simulations, which are
world’s foremost repositories in this field, enhance student learning experience. Students are also
mandated to do a research project as part of their coursework and publish a paper thereby further
enriching and reinforcing their strategic thinking and problem-solving abilities.
Communication Skills
“The art of communication is the language of leadership” – Presidential speechwriter James Humes couldn’t
have said it better. With its mission to shape future leaders, XIME is highly focused on ensuring that the
students develop their abilities to connect with their stakeholders through communication strategies and
skills. Dedicated credit courses are designed to elevate business communication (oral and written) skills,
ensuring students are well-prepared for interviews and the corporate world. XIME’s flagship event, the
Maria Philip Future Leaders Debate, assembles brilliant young speakers nationwide that rigorously test
their exceptional communication prowess.
Social Intelligence
XIME fosters social intelligence in many ways. It is promoted by a balanced gender ratio of 50:50 across all
campuses, academic diversity with students from various educational backgrounds, and by ensuring a mix
of experienced and fresh students. Cultural diversity, however, steals the spotlight, as students from
approximately 25 states come together. The unique Socially Useful and Productive Activity (SUPA), a
three-week internship, engages students in projects benefiting the less fortunate, contributing to a culture
of inclusivity and preparing future leaders for social impact.less fortunate, contributing to a culture of

Emotional Intelligence
Daniel Goleman, the father of emotional intelligence, asserts that “emotional intelligence is the largest
predictor of workplace success.” Recruiters consistently highlight that XIME students demonstrate
exceptional emotional balance compared to their peers. Beyond academics, XIME’s training modules
prioritizes interpersonal skills, self-awareness, and empathy through diverse activities and group
discussions. The 100% residential campus facility fosters personal development, enabling students to
build camaraderie and essential emotional intelligence for navigating professional challenges with
sensitivity.

The curriculum is designed to empower students in forging and nurturing professional connections through
networking events, mentorship programs, and industry interactions. XIME’s location with strong industry
linkages drive good internships and live projects. Engagement in diverse clubs and national-scale events
fosters good interactions. This emphasis on relationship building prepares our future leaders to connect
with a wide range of stakeholders, contributing to their overall personality development.
Critical Thinking
XIME cultivates critical thinking through its curriculum. A unique aspect of XIME is that research project is a
mandatory credit course and every student at XIME is encouraged and guided to publish their works. The
research process, with its demands for critical thinking, perseverance, knowledge creation, and patience,
equips students with valuable critical thinking and problem-solving abilities.
Broadened Worldview
XIME instils a global mindset by integrating broad perspectives into its curriculum. With a faculty comprising
a mix of industry and academic experts, including visiting faculty, students gain insights that bridge theory
and industry practice. International linkages and partnerships with institutions worldwide expand students’
horizons.
XIME’s curriculum not only covers core management topics but also includes credits for diverse subjects,
fostering a holistic approach to business and societal leadership. The subjects provide:
• Contemporary Business Environment – Students can analyse how global events/trends or
macroeconomic policies impact business during this course.
• Leadership in Action – The focus is on business case studies on leadership from across the world and
being socially responsible leadership.
• Learning Circle – Incorporates and develops discussions on Classic Harvard articles to broaden and
challenge multiple perspectives.
• Entrepreneurship – Decades before the start-up culture became a strong force, XIME’s curriculum was
designed to encourage entrepreneurship in young minds. This, in fact, has been embedded in the
Institute’s name–Xavier Institute of Management and Entrepreneurship (XIME).
In short, the XIME experience is all about ‘Knowing, Doing & Being’ - a framework followed by the best
learning institutions worldwide, including Harvard. Every student of XIME passes out as a team player,
