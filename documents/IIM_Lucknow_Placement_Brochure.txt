Director’s
Message

I proudly present the students of PGP-SM and cordially welcome you to take 
part in our placement process and jointly contribute to building sustainable 
societies.

We are presently at a juncture of human history when our businesses cannot be successful without roping in the crucial 
facets  of  sustainability  within  its  strategy.  Amalgamating  such  a  strategy  with  the  aspiration  to  maintain  economic, 
social, and environmental synergy is one of the most crucial goals of modern leaders. This evolving paradigm brings into 
foray a new challenge in front of the leaders, finding individuals with the right level of empathy, intent, knowledge, skill, 
and experience to work for achieving the evolved ambition of their businesses. 

To  cater  to  this  ever-growing  need  of  the  businesses,  IIM  Lucknow,  with  its  vision  of  providing  socially  conscious  and 
globally relevant thought leadership, became a pioneer in introducing a dedicated two-year full-time Post Graduate 
Programme in Sustainable Management (PGP-SM) from its Noida campus. I proudly present the students of PGP-SM 
and cordially welcome you to take part in our placement process and jointly contribute to building sustainable societies. 

The dynamics of global and national businesses are increasingly being shaped by sustainability concerns. In the last 
two decades, as societies and businesses have become more aware about environmental degradation and climate 
change,  more  emphasis  is  being  put  on  understanding  of  associated  socio-economic  implications  and  sustainable 
development,  which  are  vital  for  businesses  and  societies  alike.  Social,  economic  and  environmental  sustainability 
have emerged on the forefront of business strategy and businesses are increasingly aligning their vision so as to be 
consistent with the global vision as well as vision of the geographies in which they are present. The changed business 
environment  and  evolving  domestic  and  global  policies  and  regulations  are  forcing  companies  to  deal  with  a  wide 
range of stakeholders that have dynamically evolving, and often conflicting demands from business.

I proudly present the students of PGP-SM and cordially welcome you to take 
part in our placement process and jointly contribute to building sustainable 
societies.

Post Graduate Programme in Sustainable Management (PGP-SM) is a meticulously designed two-year residential MBA 
programme to sharpen the skills of young professionals in sustainability management. Growing environmental, social 
and individual level challenges with uncertainties make us all not only aware but sensitive to the continuously innovative 
requirements to meet the needs of government, corporates and individuals keeping in focus the environmental concerns. 
PGPSM programme equips its students to think, strategize and perform on this fundamental principal. This is the guiding 
force to our students to become and remain dependable performers throughout their career paths.

This program is contemporary and unique in its approach and content. The meticulously designed curriculum of PGPSM 
places a strong focus on applying theoretical concepts to real-world business scenarios through an applied learning 
approach especially with summer placement, 6 month long live integrated project with corporates, and the international 
immersion module. The hands-on projects provide a holistic understanding of real world at national and international 
levels.

A  formal  education  helps  one  in  number  of  ways  to  excel  in  one’s  career.  It  provides  required  knowledge  and  skills 
to perform on a job. However, a right mind set and a right approach to life with positive attitude in addition to formal 
education provides an ideal ground to excel in one’s career. A rigorous schedule with attitude to serve society at large 
instils an indefatigable spirit in our students, ensuring they emerge as the best versions of themselves. I take pleasure 
in introducing the students of PGP-SM and welcoming you as a partner in our journey of building exemplary talent and 
jointly contribute to building sustainable societies. On behalf of the Career Development Services of IIM Lucknow, I am 
delighted to welcome you to be a part of the Placement Processes for PGP-SM.

Message from
Chairperson, 
PGPSM

I proudly present the students of PGP-SM and cordially welcome you to take 
part in our placement process and jointly contribute to building sustainable 
societies.

With an ever-increasing exposure of businesses worldwide to non-financial risks and with environmental social and 
governance  (ESG)  issues  becoming  more  material  and  mainstream  in  investment  decision-making,  the  Securities 
and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) recently made it mandatory for 1000 top listed entities in India to furnish a Business 
Responsibility Report (BRR) to stock exchanges as a part of their Annual Report.

The businesses globally and in India are not just looking for conventional business leaders anymore but for a pool of 
newly skilled professionals who can marry the disciplinary management skills with specialized knowledge on business 
sustainability and responsibility to envision a more trustworthy business of tomorrow. 

IIML rose to the occasion to fill the void and happens to be the only IIM in India to offer a unique full-time Post Graduate 
Programme in Sustainable Management (PGP-SM) that imparts and nurtures these desired skillsets.

I  am  glad  to  introduce  the  PGP-SM  batch  of  2023-25  and  would  like  to  welcome  you  as  a  continued  partner  in  our 
journey of building a more resilient business and society for tomorrow.
